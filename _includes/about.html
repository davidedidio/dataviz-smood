        This visualization is based on data aquired from Smood, a food delivery company based in Switzerland. Its aim is is to gain insights into the deliveries made in the Lausanne area. For this purpose, the number of deliveries passing through each road is represented by a color map. To gain more specific insights, one can select deliveries by time, restaurant or by road. For more detail, <a id='about-start-story' href='#'>replay the story</a>.
