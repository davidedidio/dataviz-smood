## About the visualization

This visualization is based on data aquired from Smood, a food delivery company based in Switzerland. Its aim is is to gain insights into the deliveries made in the Lausanne area. For this purpose, we display a heatmap showing the number of deliveries passing through each road is represented. To gain more specific insights, one can select deliveries by time, by restaurant or by road.
